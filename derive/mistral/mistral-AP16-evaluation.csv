**Input:**

**Existing Process:**

```
Start Event
   |
Task A
   |
Exclusive Gateway (Diverging)
   |
   |-- Task B -- Task C
   |
   |-- Task D -- Task E
   |
Converging Exclusive Gateway

**User Modifications:**

1. ""Insert a new task 'Task F' between 'Task A' and the exclusive gateway.""
2. ""Embed 'Task C' in a post-conditional loop.""
3. ""Replace 'Task D' with 'Task G'.""
4. ""Swap the branches following the exclusive gateway.""
