27,True,False,"fuck the original process. create a new process with task A at the beginning, followed by subprocess F.",NA
28,True,True,transform everything except task A into a subprocess,"To transform everything except Task A into a subprocess, we need to evaluate the modification based on the provided change patterns and BPMN semantics.

1. **Validation**: The modification specifies transforming everything except Task A into a subprocess. This information is sufficient and unambiguous.

2. **Mapping to Change Pattern**: This modification maps to ""AP6"": Extract Sub Process. Extracts an existing process fragment to encapsulate it in a separate sub process.

3. **Deriving the Actual Meaning**: Based on BPMN semantics and the intent of the change pattern, the actual meaning of the modification is:

""Encapsulate all activities and elements except Task A into a separate subprocess."""
29,True,True,"Simplify the process to only show task A and the rest as ""subprocess F"".",NA.
30,True,True,"Please insert subprocess F after task A and remove task B, C and D",NA.

32,True,True,Replace everything except task A with a subprocess F.,NA.
33,True,True,Display the process from the Split Gateway to the end of the process as subprocess F,"To evaluate and interpret the user-provided modification, let's break down the request step by step:

1. **Validation of Information**:
   - The user wants to display the process from the Split Gateway to the end of the process as a subprocess named ""F"".
   - This modification contains sufficient and unambiguous information to be applied.

2. **Mapping to Change Pattern**:
   - The modification involves extracting a part of the process and encapsulating it in a separate subprocess.
   - This corresponds to the change pattern **AP6: Extract Sub Process**.

3. **Deriving the Actual Meaning**:
   - Based on BPMN semantics and the intent of the change pattern AP6, the user wants to take the sequence of activities from the Split Gateway to the end of the process and encapsulate it within a subprocess named ""F"".

4. **Ensuring Compliance with BPMN Rules**:
   - Extracting a subprocess is a valid operation in BPMN.
   - The structure of the existing process should allow for the extraction without violating any BPMN modeling rules.

Given the above analysis, the actual meaning of the user input in natural language is:

**Encapsulate the sequence of activities from the Split Gateway to the end of the process within a subprocess named ""F"".**"
34,True,True,After task A add subprocess F. Then end the process. Remove all other tasks.,NA.
35,False,False,"summarize tasks b,c and d and their paths in subprocess F ",False

59,True,True,"Simplify everything after task A but before the end of the process with ""subprocess F"".",NA
60,True,True,Change the flow and put ecerything after Task A into a subprocess F,NA.
61,True,True,all tasks after task a are subprocess f,"To evaluate and interpret the user-provided modification ""all tasks after task a are subprocess f,"" we need to follow the steps outlined:

(a) **Validating the modification**: The statement ""all tasks after task a are subprocess f"" is somewhat ambiguous. It does not specify exactly which tasks are being referred to or how they are being modified. Additionally, it does not clarify whether ""subprocess f"" is an existing subprocess or a new one.

(b) **Mapping to a change pattern**: Based on the provided information, the closest change pattern could be ""AP6"": Extract Sub Process. However, the statement is not clear enough to definitively map it to this pattern.

(c) **Deriving the actual meaning**: Given the ambiguity, it is challenging to derive a precise meaning. The statement seems to suggest that all tasks following ""task a"" should be encapsulated within a subprocess ""f,"" but it lacks specific details.

(d) **Ensuring compliance with BPMN rules**: Without clear information on the tasks and the subprocess, it is not possible to ensure compliance with BPMN rules.

Given the lack of sufficient and unambiguous information, the final output is:

NA"
62,True,False,Make a new process task A directly leads to subprocess F.,NA
63,False,False,Delete evertything after task A. Then add a subprocess F after A.,False
