1,True,True,Add a loop after the closing XOR gateway. The loop is exited if a condition is true and a further iteration is performed if a condition is false. Then include task D in the loop so that it can be executed between 0 and n times.,"The modification means that a loop has been added after the closing XOR gateway in the process model. This loop will allow for the repeated execution of task D as long as a specified condition is false. Once the condition becomes true, the loop will be exited, and task D will have been executed between 0 and N times."
2,True,False,"Add an node, which directs only false values to task D and true to the end","The modification means that a new gateway node has been added to the process model. This gateway will evaluate a condition and, based on the result, will direct the flow. If the condition is true, the process will proceed to the end. If the condition is false, the process will direct to task D."
3,True,True,task D should be in a loop where it is optional to be executed,"The modification means that task D will now be enclosed in a loop that allows it to be executed zero or more times, making its execution optional and repeatable."
4,True,False,"In the new model, if task B or C is false, task D should be done. Afterwards task D will be checked, if task D is false, task D will be repeated again.","The modification means: ""If either task B or task C is not completed successfully (false), task D will be performed. After task D is completed, it will be evaluated. If task D is not successful (false), it will be repeated until successful."""
5,True,False,"Please add two if-else-blocks, one before task D and one after task D that form a loop which, when turned true exists and while false feeds back the input to task D. ",NA.

7,True,False,"Relocate task D and insert two or-gates, a opening one and a closing one. After the already existing closing or-gate I want you to insert the following structure: First, add the closing or-gate followed by the opening one. If the condition corresponding to the opening or-gate is true, continue with the end of the process. If the condition is false, I want task D to be performed and the process to 'jump' back to the freshly added closing or-gate. In the resulting process model, task D only occurs in this certain 'back-jump' loop. ","The modification embeds a process fragment in a loop, allowing for repeated execution of task D between 1 and N times. The loop starts with an opening gate that evaluates a condition. If the condition is true, the process proceeds to the end. If the condition is false, task D is performed, and the process loops back to the closing gate to reevaluate the condition. Task D is only performed within this loop."
8,True,False,add a branched loop encapsuling task D when false and continue when true,"The modification means that a decision point has been added to the process. If the condition is true, the process continues as usual. If the condition is false, task D is repeated within a loop before the process continues."
9,True,False,"Add a loop for task D. check first if the status is true, if so nothing needs to be done if it is false, task D needs to be done and then check again for the status. ","The modification means that task D will be repeated in a loop until its status becomes true. In each iteration, the process will check the status first. If the status is true, the loop will exit.

This gateway will evaluate a condition, and task ""d"" will only be executed if the condition is false."
11,True,False,"instead of task D, add an extra step where two more X's following each other. if the condition statement after the second X is true, then reach the output, if false, add task D and return to the first X after task D.","The modification means that instead of performing task D once, the process will now include a loop. In this loop, two new tasks (let's call them X1 and X2) will be executed sequentially. After X2, a condition will be checked. If the condition is true, the process will proceed to the output. If the condition is false, task D will be executed, and the process will return to the first new task (X1) to repeat the loop."
12,True,True,"add an xor gate before and after task d, only execute task d if the result of the gate after task d is false and return to the xor gate before task d","The modification means that task ""d"" will now be repeated in a loop until a certain condition is met. Before starting task ""d"", an exclusive gateway (XOR) will evaluate a condition. If the condition is true, task ""d"" will be executed. After task ""d"" is completed, another exclusive gateway will check a condition. If this condition is false, the process will loop back to the first exclusive gateway before task ""d"" and repeat the evaluation.

If condition in OR split is  'true' process should end, otherwise 'task D' should be executed.",The modification means that 'task D' will now be repeated zero to many times within a loop that starts after the 'OR join'. The loop uses an 'OR' gateway to decide whether to end the process if the condition is 'true' or to execute 'task D' again if the condition is not 'true'.
18,True,False,Introduce a choice node before the final state which goes to final with true and to task D with false. Task D should only be accessible using the false path,"The modification means that a decision point has been added just before the end of the process.

24,True,False,"add a loop surrounding task D using a gate. In the false branch of the gate, the task D should be triggered, else the process should stop","The modification means that task D will now be repeated in a loop, with a gateway determining whether to repeat task D or stop the process.

30,False,False,I don't know how to describe this,False
31,True,False,Insert to exclusive gateways before task D. The second inserted gateway should be connected to task B and the termination event. Task D should be connected to the first inserted gateway. ,"The modification means that a decision point is added before task D. If a certain condition is met, task D will be executed. Otherwise, the process will either move to task B or end."
32,True,True,"Replace task D with a conditional loop, where the false branch contains task D and the true branch ends the process. It must be possible for task D to not be executed.","The modification means that task D will now be part of a conditional loop, allowing it to be executed zero or more times. Before each potential execution of task D, a condition will be checked. If the condition is true, the process will end.
