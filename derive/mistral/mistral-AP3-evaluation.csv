41,True,True,at the moment we differentiate between true or false after task a. This goes into either task b or task c. I would like to put task c in a different spot. It should still differentiate between true or false but they should both result in task c now which then follows task and the end.,"The user input suggests a modification to the process flow where the decision point after Task A is altered. Instead of branching into Task B or Task C based on a true or false condition, both conditions should lead to Task C, which is then followed by another task and the end of the process.

This modification can be mapped to the change pattern AP10: ""Embed Process Fragment in Conditional Branch. An existing process fragment is embedded in a conditional branch"".

The actual meaning of the modification is:

""After completing Task A, the process will always proceed to Task C regardless of the true or false condition. Following Task C, the process will continue to the next task and then end."""
