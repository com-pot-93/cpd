1,True,True,Introduce a parallel flow which starts before the opening XOR gateway and merges after the closing XOR gateway. Then move task D into this newly created parallel flow so that it is executed in parallel to the whole XOR.,"The modification means that task D, which was previously part of a sequential flow, will now be executed in parallel with the existing sequence of activities that are controlled by the XOR gateways. This change allows task D to occur simultaneously with the other tasks managed by the XOR gateways, rather than waiting for them to complete."
2,True,True,make out of task D an parrallel task after task A,"The modification means that task D, which was originally performed after task A in sequence, should now be executed in parallel with task A.

Explanation:

The change pattern AP9 - Parallelize Process Fragments aims to convert sequential tasks into parallel tasks. In this context, the modification specifies that task D, which was initially designed to follow task A sequentially, should now be performed concurrently with task A. This change promotes parallel processing, potentially enhancing efficiency by allowing both tasks to be executed simultaneously rather than one after the other."
3,True,False,"create task D and create a new branch after task A, so that task D can be executed instead of task B and C","The modification means that a new task, Task D, has been created and a new branch has been added after Task A. This new branch allows for the execution of Task D instead of Tasks B and C, based on a certain condition."
4,True,False,"In the new model, after task A, if one condition is filled, task D will be done, then the system finishes.","The modification means that after completing task A, there is a decision point where if a specific condition is met, task D will be executed.

7,True,False,"Relocate task D and insert two gates, an opening and-gate and a closing and-gate. After task A the opening and-gate with two paths should follow. One path is the or-block of the input process model without any changes, meaning that the or-gate is immediately following after the opening and-gate. The second path of the freshly inserted opening and-gate directs to task D being performed. After that, both paths meet each other again in the closing and-gate. In the resulting process model task D only appears in the second and-gate path since it was relocated.","The modification means that task D is moved to a new position in the process. After completing task A, the process now splits into two parallel paths at an opening AND-gate. One path continues with the original OR-block from the input process model, while the second path leads to the execution of task D. After both paths are completed, they synchronize at a closing AND-gate. Task D is only present in the second path of the AND-gate and has been removed from its original position."

Branch 1 is the previous xor section and Branch 2 contains only task D.Both branches are connected with a closing parallel which is inserted before the end,"The modification means that after completing task A, two branches will now execute simultaneously. The first branch will perform the existing exclusive (XOR) section, while the second branch will execute task D. Once both branches are complete, the process will proceed to the end."
20,True,True,insert task D parallel to task B and task C,"The modification means that a new task, Task D, has been added to the process model and should be executed concurrently with both Task B and Task C, rather than sequentially."
21,True,True,"please add a parallel path after task A where task D is moved to one branch of this parallel path, and the other branch is connected to the original exclusive choice.","The modification means that after completing Task A, two branches will now run simultaneously.
