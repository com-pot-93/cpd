22,True,True,divide task B & E into two several tasks. ,"To divide tasks B and E into several tasks, we need to understand the context and the specific activities involved in these tasks within the BPMN process model. However, since the details of tasks B and E are not provided, I will assume a general approach to dividing any task into sub-tasks.

Let's assume tasks B and E are generic tasks that can be broken down into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks. Here is how you might divide them:

### Task B:
1. **Sub-task B1**: Prepare necessary documents.
2. **Sub-task B2**: Review and approve documents.
3. **Sub-task B3**: Submit documents for further processing.

### Task E:
1. **Sub-task E1**: Gather required materials.
2. **Sub-task E2**: Assemble materials into a final product.
3. **Sub-task E3**: Quality check the final product.
4. **Sub-task E4**: Package the final product for delivery.

Given the instructions, the actual meaning of the user input in natural language is:

""Divide task B into three sub-tasks: prepare necessary documents, review and approve documents, and submit documents for further processing. Divide task E into four sub-tasks: gather required materials, assemble materials into a final product, quality check the final product, and package the final product for delivery."""
