To apply the changes to the model, I need to know the specific modifications you want to make. Since you mentioned "e" without further details, I'll assume you want to add or modify an element related to "e". However, without specific instructions, I can't make any changes.

Please provide detailed modifications you want to apply to the model, such as adding a new task, changing a gateway type, or modifying conditions. Once I have that information, I can update the Mermaid.js code accordingly.
