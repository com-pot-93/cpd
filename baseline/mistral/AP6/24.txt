To apply the changes to the model, I need to know the specific modifications you want to make. Since you haven't provided any specific changes, I'll assume you want to validate and ensure the model complies with BPMN rules and Mermaid.js syntax. Here is the validated and transformed Mermaid.js code based on the provided model:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
0:startevent:((startevent))-->1:task:(task A)
1:task:-->2:exclusivegateway:{x}
2:exclusivegateway:-->|true|3:task:(task B)
2:exclusivegateway:-->|false|5:task:(task C)
3:task:-->6:exclusivegateway:{x}
5:task:-->6:exclusivegateway:
6:exclusivegateway:-->7:task:(task D)
7:task:-->8:endevent:(((endevent)))
```

If you have specific modifications in mind, please provide them, and I can adjust the model accordingly.
