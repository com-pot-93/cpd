To apply the changes to the model, I need to know the specific modifications you want to make. Since you mentioned "d" without further details, I'll assume you want to add or modify a node with the identifier "d". However, identifiers must be integers, so I'll need more context to proceed accurately.

Please provide the specific modifications you want to apply to the model, such as adding a new task, changing a gateway type, or modifying conditions. Once I have that information, I can update the Mermaid.js BPMN model accordingly.
