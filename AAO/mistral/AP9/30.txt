To apply the changes to the model, I need specific details about the modifications you want to make. Here are some examples of modifications you might request:

1. **Add a new task**: Specify the task label and where it should be inserted in the process.
2. **Change the type of a node**: For example, change a task to a subprocess.
3. **Add or modify conditions**: Change the conditions on the edges.
4. **Add or remove gateways**: Specify the type of gateway and its position in the process.
5. **Rearrange the flow**: Change the order of tasks or gateways.

Please provide the specific modifications you want to apply to the BPMN process model. Once I have that information, I can update the model accordingly and ensure it adheres to the Mermaid.js syntax and BPMN 2.0 notation rules.
