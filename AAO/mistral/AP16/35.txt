To apply the changes specified by "AP16" to the given BPMN model, I need to know what "AP16" refers to. Since the specific changes aren't detailed, I'll assume "AP16" might be a placeholder for a set of modifications. Without the exact details, I'll provide a general approach to how you might apply changes to the model.

Let's assume "AP16" includes the following changes:
1. Add a new task between task B and task E.
2. Add a condition to the false branch of the first exclusive gateway.
3. Ensure all gateways have proper split and merge points.

Here is the modified Mermaid.js BPMN model:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
0:startevent:((startevent))-->1:task:(task A)
1:task:-->2:exclusivegateway:{x}
2:exclusivegateway:-->|true|3:task:(task B)
3:task:-->4:task:(new task)
4:task:-->9:task:(task E)
2:exclusivegateway:-->|false|5:task:(task C)
9:task:-->6:exclusivegateway:{x}
5:task:-->6:exclusivegateway:
6:exclusivegateway:--> 7:task:(task D)
7:task:-->8:endevent:(((endevent)))
```

In this modified model:
- A new task (id: 4) has been added between task B (id: 3) and task E (id: 9).
- The condition for the false branch of the first exclusive gateway (id: 2) has been specified.
- All gateways have proper split and merge points as required.
