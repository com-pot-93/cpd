To apply the changes specified by "AP13" to the given BPMN model, I need to know what "AP13" stands for. Since the specific changes aren't detailed, I'll assume a common scenario where "AP13" might refer to adding an additional task or modifying an existing one. For the sake of this example, let's assume "AP13" means adding a new task after "task B" and before the merge gateway.

Here is the modified Mermaid.js BPMN model:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
0:startevent:((startevent))-->1:task:(task A)
1:task:-->2:exclusivegateway:{x}
2:exclusivegateway:-->|true|3:task:(task B)
3:task:-->4:task:(task E)
4:task:-->6:exclusivegateway:{x}
2:exclusivegateway:-->|false|5:task:(task C)
5:task:-->6:exclusivegateway:
6:exclusivegateway:--> 7:task:(task D)
7:task:-->8:endevent:(((endevent)))
```

In this modified model, a new task "task E" (with id 4) has been added after "task B" and before the merge gateway. If "AP13" refers to a different set of changes, please provide the specific details, and I can adjust the model accordingly.
