To apply the changes specified by "AP13" to the given BPMN model, I need to know what "AP13" refers to. Since the specific changes aren't detailed, I'll assume "AP13" might be a typo or shorthand for a set of modifications that aren't fully described.

Given the lack of specific instructions, I'll provide a validated and slightly optimized version of the original model to ensure it adheres to the Mermaid.js syntax and BPMN 2.0 notation rules. If you have specific changes in mind, please provide them, and I can apply those changes accordingly.

Here is the validated and slightly optimized version of the original model:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
0:startevent:((startevent)) --> 1:task:(task A)
1:task: --> 2:exclusivegateway:{x}
2:exclusivegateway: --> |true| 3:task:(task B)
2:exclusivegateway: --> |false| 5:task:(task C)
3:task: --> 6:exclusivegateway:{x}
5:task: --> 6:exclusivegateway:
6:exclusivegateway: --> 7:task:(task D)
7:task: --> 8:endevent:(((endevent)))
```

If you provide the specific changes referred to by "AP13," I can apply those modifications to the model.
