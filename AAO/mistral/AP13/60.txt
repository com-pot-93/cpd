To apply the changes specified by "AP13" to the given BPMN model, I need to know what "AP13" refers to. Since the specific changes aren't detailed in your request, I'll assume "AP13" might be a typo or a placeholder for actual modifications.

Given the lack of specific instructions, I'll validate and ensure the model adheres to the Mermaid.js syntax rules for BPMN models as described. Here is the corrected and validated Mermaid.js BPMN model:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
0:startevent:((startevent)) --> 1:task:(task A)
1:task: --> 2:exclusivegateway:{x}
2:exclusivegateway: --> |true| 3:task:(task B)
2:exclusivegateway: --> |false| 5:task:(task C)
3:task: --> 6:exclusivegateway:{x}
5:task: --> 6:exclusivegateway:
6:exclusivegateway: --> 7:task:(task D)
7:task: --> 8:endevent:(((endevent)))
```

If you provide the specific changes represented by "AP13," I can apply those modifications accordingly.
