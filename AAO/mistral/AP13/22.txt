To apply the changes specified by "AP13" to the given BPMN model, I need to know what "AP13" stands for. Since the specific changes aren't detailed, I'll assume "AP13" refers to a set of predefined modifications. However, without the explicit details of "AP13," I'll proceed with a common interpretation based on typical process improvements or adjustments.

Let's assume "AP13" involves the following changes:
1. Add a new task after "task A" but before the exclusive gateway.
2. Ensure all gateways have proper split and merge points.
3. Add annotations to the edges for better clarity.

Here is the modified Mermaid.js BPMN model:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
0:startevent:((startevent)) --> 1:task:(task A)
1:task: --> 9:task:(new task)
9:task: --> 2:exclusivegateway:{x}
2:exclusivegateway: --> |true| 3:task:(task B)
2:exclusivegateway: --> |false| 5:task:(task C)
3:task: --> 6:exclusivegateway:{x}
5:task: --> 6:exclusivegateway:
6:exclusivegateway: --> 7:task:(task D)
7:task: --> 8:endevent:(((endevent)))
```

In this modified model:
- A new task (id: 9) is added after "task A" and before the exclusive gateway.
- All gateways have proper split and merge points.
- Edge labels are used to indicate conditions for better clarity.
