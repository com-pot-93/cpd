To apply the changes specified by "AP13" to the given BPMN model, I need to know what "AP13" refers to. Since "AP13" is not a standard term in BPMN or Mermaid.js, I'll assume it might be a typo or shorthand for a specific set of modifications. However, without explicit details on what "AP13" entails, I'll proceed with a common interpretation: adding an additional task after task D and before the end event.

Here is the modified Mermaid.js BPMN model with the assumed changes:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
0:startevent:((startevent))-->1:task:(task A)
1:task:-->2:exclusivegateway:{x}
2:exclusivegateway:-->|true|3:task:(task B)
2:exclusivegateway:-->|false|5:task:(task C)
3:task:-->6:exclusivegateway:{x}
5:task:-->6:exclusivegateway:
6:exclusivegateway:--> 7:task:(task D)
7:task:-->9:task:(task E)
9:task:-->8:endevent:(((endevent)))
```

In this modified model, I added a new task (task E) with the ID 9 after task D and before the end event. If "AP13" refers to a different set of changes, please provide the specific modifications, and I can adjust the model accordingly.
