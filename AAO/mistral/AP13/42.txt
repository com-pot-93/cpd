To apply the changes specified by "AP13" to the given BPMN model, I need to know what "AP13" stands for. Since the specific modifications aren't provided, I'll assume a common scenario where "AP13" might refer to adding an additional task or modifying an existing one. For the sake of this example, let's assume "AP13" means adding a new task after task C (id: 5).

Here is the modified Mermaid.js BPMN model:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
0:startevent:((startevent))-->1:task:(task A)
1:task:-->2:exclusivegateway:{x}
2:exclusivegateway:-->|true|3:task:(task B)
2:exclusivegateway:-->|false|5:task:(task C)
5:task:-->9:task:(task E)
9:task:-->6:exclusivegateway:{x}
3:task:-->6:exclusivegateway:
6:exclusivegateway:--> 7:task:(task D)
7:task:-->8:endevent:(((endevent)))
```

In this modified model, a new task (id: 9) labeled "task E" has been added after "task C" (id: 5). The flow then continues to the exclusive gateway (id: 6) as before.
