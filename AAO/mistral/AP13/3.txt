To apply the changes specified by "AP13" to the given BPMN model, I need to know what "AP13" refers to. Since the specific modifications aren't provided, I'll assume "AP13" means adding a parallel gateway after task A and before the exclusive gateway, and ensuring the model adheres to the rules specified.

Here is the modified Mermaid.js BPMN model:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
0:startevent:((startevent))-->1:task:(task A)
1:task:-->2:parallelgateway:{AND}
2:parallelgateway:-->3:exclusivegateway:{x}
3:exclusivegateway:-->|true|4:task:(task B)
3:exclusivegateway:-->|false|6:task:(task C)
4:task:-->7:exclusivegateway:{x}
6:task:-->7:exclusivegateway:
7:exclusivegateway:-->8:parallelgateway:{AND}
8:parallelgateway:-->9:task:(task D)
9:task:-->10:endevent:(((endevent)))
```

In this modified model:
- A parallel gateway (id: 2) is added after task A (id: 1) to initiate a split.
- Another parallel gateway (id: 8) is added before task D (id: 9) to merge the split.
- The exclusive gateway (id: 3) handles the conditional split.
- The exclusive gateway (id: 7) handles the merge of the conditional paths.
- The model ensures that each gateway has both a split and a merge point, adhering to the rules specified.
