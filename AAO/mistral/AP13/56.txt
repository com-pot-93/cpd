To apply the changes specified by "AP13" to the given BPMN model, I need to know what "AP13" stands for. Since the specific modifications aren't provided, I'll assume "AP13" refers to a set of predefined changes. For the sake of this example, let's assume "AP13" means:

1. Add a new task "task E" after "task D".
2. Change the label of "task A" to "task A1".
3. Add a condition "new condition" to the edge from "task B" to the exclusive gateway.

Given these assumptions, here is the modified Mermaid.js BPMN model:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
0:startevent:((startevent))-->1:task:(task A1)
1:task:-->2:exclusivegateway:{x}
2:exclusivegateway:-->|true|3:task:(task B)
2:exclusivegateway:-->|false|5:task:(task C)
3:task:-->|new condition|6:exclusivegateway:{x}
5:task:-->6:exclusivegateway:
6:exclusivegateway:--> 7:task:(task D)
7:task:-->9:task:(task E)
9:task:-->8:endevent:(((endevent)))
```

This model includes the specified changes:
1. A new task "task E" is added after "task D".
2. The label of "task A" is changed to "task A1".
3. A condition "new condition" is added to the edge from "task B" to the exclusive gateway.
