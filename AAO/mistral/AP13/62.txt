To apply the changes specified by "AP13" to the given BPMN model, I need to know what "AP13" refers to. Since the specific changes aren't detailed, I'll assume "AP13" might be a typo or shorthand for a set of modifications that aren't explicitly provided.

Given the lack of specific instructions, I'll validate and ensure the model adheres to the Mermaid.js syntax rules for BPMN models as described. Here is the corrected and validated Mermaid.js BPMN model:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
0:startevent:((startevent)) --> 1:task:(task A)
1:task: --> 2:exclusivegateway:{x}
2:exclusivegateway: --> |true| 3:task:(task B)
2:exclusivegateway: --> |false| 5:task:(task C)
3:task: --> 6:exclusivegateway:{x}
5:task: --> 6:exclusivegateway:
6:exclusivegateway: --> 7:task:(task D)
7:task: --> 8:endevent:(((endevent)))
```

This model ensures that:
1. Each node has a unique identifier.
2. The types and shapes of the nodes are correctly specified.
3. Gateways have both split and merge points.
4. Edge labels are used for conditions or annotations.
5. The direction is left to right (LR).

If "AP13" refers to specific modifications, please provide the details so I can apply them accurately.
