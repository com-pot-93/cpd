To apply the changes specified by "AP13" to the given BPMN model, I need to know what "AP13" stands for. Since the specific changes aren't detailed, I'll assume a common scenario where "AP13" might refer to adding an approval task after task B.

Here is the modified Mermaid.js BPMN model with the assumed changes:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
0:startevent:((startevent))-->1:task:(task A)
1:task:-->2:exclusivegateway:{x}
2:exclusivegateway:-->|true|3:task:(task B)
3:task:-->13:task:(Approval Task)
13:task:-->6:exclusivegateway:{x}
2:exclusivegateway:-->|false|5:task:(task C)
5:task:-->6:exclusivegateway:
6:exclusivegateway:--> 7:task:(task D)
7:task:-->8:endevent:(((endevent)))
```

In this modified model, I added a new task with id 13, labeled "Approval Task," after task B. If you have a different interpretation of "AP13," please provide more details so I can adjust the model accordingly.
