To apply the changes specified by "AP13" to the given BPMN model, I need to know what "AP13" refers to. Since the specific changes aren't detailed, I'll assume "AP13" might involve adding or modifying certain elements in the process. For the sake of this example, let's assume "AP13" involves adding an additional task after "task D" and before the "end event."

Here is the modified Mermaid.js BPMN model:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
0:startevent:((startevent))-->1:task:(task A)
1:task:-->2:exclusivegateway:{x}
2:exclusivegateway:-->|true|3:task:(task B)
2:exclusivegateway:-->|false|5:task:(task C)
3:task:-->6:exclusivegateway:{x}
5:task:-->6:exclusivegateway:
6:exclusivegateway:--> 7:task:(task D)
7:task:-->9:task:(task E)
9:task:-->8:endevent:(((endevent)))
```

In this modified model, I've added a new task with the label "task E" (id: 9) after "task D" and before the "end event." If "AP13" refers to different changes, please provide the specific details, and I can adjust the model accordingly.
