To apply the changes specified in "AP8.2" to the given BPMN model, I need to know what "AP8.2" refers to. Since the specific changes aren't provided, I'll assume a common scenario where "AP8.2" might refer to adding an additional task or modifying the existing flow. For the sake of this example, let's assume "AP8.2" means adding a new task after task D and before the end event.

Here is the modified Mermaid.js BPMN model:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
0:startevent:((startevent))-->1:task:(task A)
1:task:-->2:exclusivegateway:{x}
2:exclusivegateway:-->|true|3:task:(task B)
2:exclusivegateway:-->|false|5:task:(task C)
3:task:-->6:exclusivegateway:{x}
5:task:-->6:exclusivegateway:
6:exclusivegateway:--> 7:task:(task D)
7:task:-->9:task:(task E)
9:task:-->8:endevent:(((endevent)))
```

In this modified model, a new task (task E) with id 9 has been added between task D and the end event. If "AP8.2" refers to a different set of changes, please provide the specific details, and I can adjust the model accordingly.
