To apply the changes specified as "AP8.2" to the given BPMN model, we need to interpret what "AP8.2" means. Since the instruction is not clear, I will assume "AP8.2" refers to adding a parallel gateway after task D (node 7) and before the end event (node 8). This will involve adding a parallel gateway and ensuring that the process flow is correctly updated.

Here is the updated Mermaid.js BPMN model:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
0:startevent:((startevent))-->1:task:(task A)
1:task:-->2:exclusivegateway:{x}
2:exclusivegateway:-->|true|3:task:(task B)
2:exclusivegateway:-->|false|5:task:(task C)
3:task:-->6:exclusivegateway:{x}
5:task:-->6:exclusivegateway:
6:exclusivegateway:--> 7:task:(task D)
7:task:-->9:parallelgateway:{AND}
9:parallelgateway:-->8:endevent:(((endevent)))
```

In this updated model, a parallel gateway (node 9) has been added after task D (node 7) and before the end event (node 8). This ensures that the process flow is correctly updated according to the assumed interpretation of "AP8.2".
