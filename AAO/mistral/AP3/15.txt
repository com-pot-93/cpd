To apply the changes specified by "AP10" to the given BPMN model, I need to know what "AP10" stands for. Since the specific modifications aren't provided, I'll assume "AP10" refers to a set of predefined changes. However, without the details of "AP10," I can't apply specific modifications.

Instead, I'll validate and ensure the given model adheres to the Mermaid.js syntax rules for BPMN models. Here is the corrected and validated Mermaid.js BPMN model:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
0:startevent:((startevent)) --> 1:task:(task A)
1:task: --> 2:exclusivegateway:{x}
2:exclusivegateway: --> |true| 3:task:(task B)
2:exclusivegateway: --> |false| 5:task:(task C)
3:task: --> 6:exclusivegateway:{x}
5:task: --> 6:exclusivegateway:
6:exclusivegateway: --> 7:task:(task D)
7:task: --> 8:endevent:(((endevent)))
```

If you provide the specific modifications represented by "AP10," I can apply those changes to the model.
