To apply the change "Insert a new activity 'Review Order' between 'Receive Order' and 'Ship Order'" to the given process model, we need to identify where 'Receive Order' and 'Ship Order' are in the current model. However, the current model does not have activities named 'Receive Order' and 'Ship Order'. Therefore, we need to assume that 'Receive Order' corresponds to 'task A' and 'Ship Order' corresponds to 'task D'.

Here is the updated Mermaid.js BPMN model with the new activity 'Review Order' inserted between 'task A' and 'task D':

```mermaid

0:startevent:((startevent))-->1:task:(task A)
1:task:-->2:exclusivegateway:{x}
2:exclusivegateway:-->|true|3:task:(task B)
2:exclusivegateway:-->|false|5:task:(task C)
3:task:-->6:exclusivegateway:{x}
5:task:-->6:exclusivegateway:
6:exclusivegateway:-->9:task:(Review Order)
9:task:-->7:task:(task D)
7:task:-->8:endevent:(((endevent)))
```

In this updated model, a new task node with the label 'Review Order' (id: 9) has been inserted between 'task A' (id: 1) and 'task D' (id: 7).
