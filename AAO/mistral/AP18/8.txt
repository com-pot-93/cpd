To apply the changes specified by "AP13" to the given BPMN model, I need to know what "AP13" refers to. Since the specific changes aren't detailed, I'll assume "AP13" might be a placeholder for a set of modifications. For the sake of this example, let's assume "AP13" includes the following changes:

1. Add a new task between "task A" and the exclusive gateway.
2. Change the condition for the path leading to "task E" from "c" to "d".
3. Add an inclusive gateway after "task D".

Here is the modified Mermaid.js BPMN model incorporating these changes:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
0:startevent:((startevent))-->1:task:(task A)
1:task:-->11:task:(new task)
11:task:-->2:exclusivegateway:{x}
2:exclusivegateway:-->|a|3:task:(task B)
2:exclusivegateway:-->|b|5:task:(task C)
2:exclusivegateway:-->|d|9:task:(task E)
9:task:-->10:task:(task F)
10:task:-->6:exclusivegateway:{x}
3:task:-->6:exclusivegateway:
5:task:-->6:exclusivegateway:
6:exclusivegateway:--> 7:task:(task D)
7:task:-->12:inclusivegateway:{O}
12:inclusivegateway:-->8:endevent:(((endevent)))
```

This model includes the specified changes:
1. A new task (id: 11) is added between "task A" and the exclusive gateway.
2. The condition for the path leading to "task E" is changed from "c" to "d".
3. An inclusive gateway (id: 12) is added after "task D".
