Instead of branching into Task B or Task C based on a true or false condition, both conditions should lead to Task C, which is then followed by another task and the end of the process.

This modification can be mapped to the change pattern AP10: ""Embed Process Fragment in Conditional Branch. An existing process fragment is embedded in a conditional branch"".
