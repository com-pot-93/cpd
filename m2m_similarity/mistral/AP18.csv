22,22,True,False,remove the condition from the process model. Now only case a can happen but no condition is needed. So that task A --> task B --> task D,"To determine the actual meaning of the user's input, let's break down the provided modification step by step:

1. **User Input Analysis**:
   - The user wants to remove a condition from the process model.
   - The user specifies that only ""case a"" can happen, and no condition is needed.
   - The user provides a sequence: Task A --> Task B --> Task D.

2. **Validation of Information**:
   - The user input specifies a clear sequence of tasks (Task A --> Task B --> Task D).
   - The input mentions removing a condition, implying there was a conditional branch that is no longer needed.

3. **Mapping to Change Pattern**:
   - The modification involves removing a conditional branch and simplifying the process flow.
   - This aligns with change pattern **AP17**: ""Delete Entire Branch. Removes single entire branch inside selected gateways and consequently flatten the hierarchy if necessary.""

4. **Deriving the Actual Meaning**:
   - The user wants to remove the conditional branch that previously existed between Task A and Task B.
   - The process should now flow directly from Task A to Task B to Task D without any conditions.

5. **Ensuring Compliance with BPMN Rules**:
   - Removing a condition and ensuring a direct flow between tasks is compliant with BPMN modeling rules.
   - The sequence Task A --> Task B --> Task D is a valid and unambiguous process flow.

**Final Output**:
Remove the conditional branch between Task A and Task B, ensuring the process flows directly from Task A to Task B to Task D without any conditions.",True,1.0
