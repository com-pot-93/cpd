1. **Add a new state after task A to check if a =1, if not go directly to the next step:**
   - This modification involves adding a conditional check after task A.
   - This can be mapped to **AP10: Embed Process Fragment in Conditional Branch**.
   - The actual meaning of the modification is: ""After task A, add a conditional branch to check if a = 1. If the condition is not met, proceed directly to the next step.""

2. **Add a new state before task D if a=1:**
   - This modification involves adding a new state before task D based on a condition.
